						for citizens of Cambridge in a sustainable way. If
						elected to represent those in Market Ward who are

						support implementation of Labour’s 4 manifesto pledges
						for the city, that is, (1) to reduce poverty and
						inequality and promote food justice, (2) to tackle the
						climate and biodiversity emergencies, including a net
						zero emissions city council by 2030, (3) to build 1000
						council homes in the next ten years, reduce
						homelessness, and give rough sleepers new opportunities,
						and (4) to protect local services despite Tory cuts,
						helping the most vulnerable during the pandemic and
						beyond. These aims can be achieved by ensuring a Labour
						majority in the city council, where all our councillors
						are committed to voting for legislation, resolutions and
						policies that will support these objectives.

						“We will enable more homes to be built. Without new
						homes being built, Cambridge will continue to become a
						more expensive, exclusive and divided place, giving rise
						to more congestion, carbon emissions and air pollution
						from long distance commuting. It is also necessary to
						build more homes in order to have the land to secure
						more affordable housing which must be 40% of any
						development. We particularly want to see a focus on
						homes for key workers in the city. In the interest of
						our city economy itself becoming more inclusive, we aim
						to carve out affordable employment space through the new
						Local Plan, which in the face of high land values, would
						enable more diverse employment activity extending
						opportunities to the whole community, not just life
						sciences and hi-tech. We also will work through the
						Greater Cambridge Partnership to improve skills training
						and careers advice for those young people not choosing
						university but looking for opportunities with local
						employers. We propose to introduce a new community
						wellbeing strategy to define priorities within council
						responsibilities and capabilities which address the
						range of factors constituting a healthy society, which
						correspond closely to the doughnut definition in
						Doughnut Economics - some of which are financial, some
						of which are not. We aim to survey residents and measure
						progress - and to engage partner bodies in complementing
						this work. In common with fast growing economies
						elsewhere, our area experiences the social stress of
						change where the same community encompasses both those
						benefitting from prosperity and those not. Local
						authorities do not share proportionately in the new
						prosperity and lack coercive powers of extra taxation.
						So, we aim to engage local businesses much more as
						partners in the social cohesion of the city they operate
						in, building on the good examples that already exist.”

						there was no action available to the City Council
						Planning Committee to hold the developers to their

						In order to get away from Greenwashing, we would insist
						that the emergency is taken into account in every
						decision the council makes and that there is an
						integrated approach to this vital issue. The Council
						budget would have to be revisited and monies moved away
						from other areas, as the present allocation is far short
						of what is required. Jeremy Caddick, Green Party
						candidate for the Abbey District Cambridgeshire County
						Council District said “We have raised this issue of
						inadequate funding for dealing with Climate Emergency at
						the budget setting meeting of the City Council and we
						will continue to do so.” We have also made the
						commitment in our manifesto to use the concept of
						doughnut economics for decisions made by elected
						councillors, which changes the goal and dialogue to
						focus on ensuring the needs of everyone are met, whilst
						not exceeding planetary boundaries. The climate and
						ecological emergencies require co-ordinated action in
						all policy areas. Elected Greens would work with other
						parties to push for action across all levels of local
						government (City, County and Combined Authority). Key
						areas to tackle include investing in a reliable and
						affordable public transport network, retrofitting
						housing to be energy efficient and requiring the highest
						environmental standards for all new builds, and
						formulating a plan to address the looming water crisis
						for our region (as set out by the Cam Valley Forum among
						others
						https://camvalleyforum.uk/publication-let-it-flow/). We
						care very deeply about protecting nature and green
						space. Rather than building over the green space we have
						left, we need to be setting aside more land for nature.
						Currently our Green Belt is being sacrificed for
						development (for example here is our consultation
						response regarding the relocation of the Waste Water
						Treatment plant to Green Belt land
						https://cambridge.greenparty.org.uk/news/submission-to-(cwwtpr)-project-phase1.html)
						while the planned new settlements have an alarming lack
						of green space provision - see our joint consultation
						response with South Cambridge Green Party
						(https://southcambs.greenparty.org.uk/news/north-east-cambridge-development-our-response.html).
						We have pushed for divestment already with the County
						Council and when elected Greens would push for the
						County Council to divest its pension fund from the
						fossil fuel industry. - See also our local manifesto for

						“The council must take a surer grip on its vital role of
						city leader. Recent progress has relied too much on
						national decisions and a lot that is inconsistent still
						seems to occur as a result of local decisions. We will
						properly embed climate change in all that the council
						does and build it into its corporate and financial
						planning processes. We will define a detailed roadmap to
						zero carbon as far before 2050 as is achievable,
						encompassing its housing and commercial property
						estates, and hold offsetting measures as supplemental or
						a last resort. And we will share and export our approach
						with other organisations. We aim for the council’s waste
						service to play a core educational role in waste
						reduction as a contribution to encouraging behaviours
						consistent with a more circular local economy,
						recognising the carbon footprint of almost everything we
						buy. We will use the council’s regulatory roles to
						influence the wider city contribution to carbon
						emissions. We will ensure that housing is located in
						sustainable locations, such as Marshals airfield and
						North East Cambridge, and that it is not permitted at
						the cost of ecological impact from exhaustion of natural
						resources such water supply - a key local element on the
						planetary boundary of Doughnut Economics. We will fight
						to exact the most sustainable design and building
						standards we have the powers to achieve as a planning
						authority and model high standards in the council’s own
						building projects in a way that had not recently
						happened. We will use our role in the Greater Cambridge
						Partnership to pursue the goal of a ‘low traffic city’,
						not only to reduce carbon emissions, but congestion and
						pollution too. We support a long overdue integrated
						policy to both reduce car journeys within the city and
						transform public transport through public subsidy into a

						Try to cut down to zero emissions by encouraging more
						cycling and walking in Cambridge. Put a proper plan in

						launch of the E-Scooters in Cambridge to reduce the
						number of cars on the road. Users must be over 18 years
						of age and have at least a provisional driving licence.
						We also think people should be required to wear helmets.
						We will work directly with the local communities and the

						together to work on practical action. Low recycling
						levels is a big problem in Cambridge. I will work with
						all community centres to increase education,
						understanding and action by residents to recycle more.

						The Climate Emergency is the defining issue of our time.

						The CEE Bill, tabled by Caroline Lucas MP represents our

						discussion point at the Council’s environment committee
						in March 2021. Matt Howard says, “There are no issues
						more pressing than the Climate and Ecological
						Emergencies which represent social injustice at a global
						level. The political cycle is so short-sighted it sees
						decade timescales to be ‘normal’ despite the last 200
						years seeing a complete runaway of human global impact.
						We are sleepwalking into disaster, with elected

						make as a society in order to even partly minimise the
						harm from the inevitable ecological shifts already
						baked-in to the planetary ecological system. I will
						raise the issue of support for this vital Bill in every
						possible forum”. Dr Hannah Charlotte Copley says “The
						climate emergency is a health emergency. We are not even
						on track to limit global heating to 2 degrees. There is
						an unacceptable risk of both simultaneous crop failure
						(which could result in mass starvation) and sea level
						rise that would make many places in the world (including
						the fenlands in Cambridgeshire) uninhabitable, this is
						already affecting communities in countries such as
						Bangladesh. We are currently undergoing the sixth mass
						extinction - this isn’t just about the loss of some
						animal species - ecological collapse will prevent
						achievement of any of our shared goals as a society of
