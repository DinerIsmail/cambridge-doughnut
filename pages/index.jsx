					Barbecue party tips can help a host put together an
					extraordinary event for family and friends. Eating outdoors
					is a favorite pastime enjoyed by everyone and planning the
					event can help make it more memorable and stress-free for
					the host. Big or small, a barbecue party requires an
					adequate amount of planning and preparation to ensure that
					everything is laid out properly. It is advisable to plan the
					event around a theme in order to create a focal point for
					the barbecue party. This way, all aspects of the party such
					as the food, games and decorations can be fashioned around a
					central theme. Favorite themes for barbecue parties include
					a Hawaiian motif, nostalgic seventies get-together, or, if
					you are near the sea, opt for a beach bbq party!
